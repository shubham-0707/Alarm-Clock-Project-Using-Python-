# Alarm-Clock-Project-Using-Python-

-In this Alarm clock user can set an alarm for any time.
-The time to be entered should be in 24 hrs format.
-After entering the time when the user presses the submit button then the process starts.
-Then python starts to check the time at every 1 second.
- When the real time matches the alarm time then it triggers the alarm sound to play.
-user can stop the alarm in between by pressing the space bar on keyboard.
-Overall the UI is good and soothing to eyes.
